# Breast Mass Detection with CNN and Autoencoders

Built a deep learning pipeline incorporating CNNs and Autoencoders to classify benign and malignant masses in mammography images. Leveraged a dataset integrating INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM sources with over 24,000 augmented images resized to 227x227 pixels. Preprocessing involved data augmentation and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization to improve feature detection and diagnostic accuracy.
